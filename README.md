# JavaScript Notes – From Basics to DOM

This repository contains **JavaScript notes, and Projects** organized chapter-wise, meant for learning JavaScript **step by step**..
The focus is on **fundamentals first** — understanding how JavaScript works before moving on to frameworks or advanced abstractions.

These notes were written while teaching / learning JavaScript in a structured way, similar to a classroom flow.

## How This Repository Is Organized

The content is divided into **chapters**, each covering a specific set of concepts.  
Each chapter contains small files focused on **one idea at a time**.

You are encouraged to **run the code**, not just read it.

## Chapter 2 – JavaScript Basics & Data Types

This chapter covers the building blocks of JavaScript.

### Topics included:
- Data types and their behavior
- Numbers, strings, booleans
- Arrays and basic operations
- `null` vs `undefined`
- Type conversion
- Comparisons
- Basic sandbox experiments

### Files you’ll see:
- `datatypes.js`
- `number.js`
- `stringMethods.js`
- `boolean.js`
- `array.js`
- `null_undefined.js`
- `typeConversion.js`
- `comp.js`
- `sandbox.js`
- `index.html` (to run examples in browser)

## Chapter 3 – Control Flow & Block Scope

This chapter introduces **decision making and repetition** in JavaScript.

### Topics included:
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Conditional logic
- `switch` statements
- Block scope with `let`
- How variables behave inside and outside blocks

Examples are intentionally simple and logged to the console for clarity.

### Topics included:
- Function declarations
- Function expressions
- Parameters and arguments
- Callback functions
- Methods vs functions

### Files you’ll see:
- `functions.js`
- `parameters.js`
- `callback_function.js`
- `methods_functions.js`

## Chapter 5 – Objects & Built-in Types

This chapter goes deeper into how JavaScript handles data internally.

### Topics included:
- Objects and object properties
- Primitive vs reference types
- The Math object
- Object behavior in memory

### Files you’ll see:
- `objects.js`
- `primitive_types.js`
- `mathObjects.js`

## Chapter 6 – DOM (Document Object Model)

This chapter introduces **DOM manipulation**, where JavaScript starts interacting with the browser.

### Topics included:
- Selecting elements
- Modifying content and styles
- Event handling
- Higher-order functions
- Objects in more depth
- Understanding how JavaScript connects to HTML

### Structure:
- `basic stuff/` – basic DOM operations
- `intro-to-dom/` – beginner-friendly DOM examples
- `dom/` – deeper DOM concepts and practice

### Files include:
- `dom.js`
- `higherOrderFunctions.js`
- `objectsInDepth.js`
- `super.js`
- `index.html`
- `style.css`

## Chapter - Projects
You have two projects here which you can rebuild to deepen your own understanding of DOM, JS , HTML and CSS.

### Structure
- Dice Challenge
- Drum Kit

## How to Use This Repository

- Start from **Chapter 2** if you’re new
- Move chapter by chapter — don’t skip
- Open `index.html` files in the browser where provided
- Check the console (`Inspect → Console`) for output
- Modify the code and observe what changes

Learning JavaScript requires **experimenting**, not memorizing.

If you understand what’s in this repo, frameworks will feel much easier later.
